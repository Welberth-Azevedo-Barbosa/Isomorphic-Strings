# Isomorphic-Strings
Solution for "Isomorphic strings"

# Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "isIsomorphic" function, which determines whether two input strings "s" and "t" are isomorphic. Two strings are considered isomorphic if the characters in "s" can be replaced to get "t". Each character in "s" should map to the same character in "t", while preserving the order of the characters. The function returns True if the strings are isomorphic, otherwise, it returns False.
